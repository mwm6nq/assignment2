    "# 1. This paper is about cleaning data through the specific way of data tidying. This paper will dive into the simple framework for data tidying, tools needed, and a case study to prove the benefits.\n",
    "# 2. It has been designed to start the initial exploration and analysis and simplyify analsyis tools that work well together. Tidy datsets and tools work togther to make everything easier.\n",
    "# 3a. The first sentence means that tidy datsets can do its best but every dataset is differnt and will reguire unique ways of cleaning it.\n",
    "# 3b. The second statement means that when data gets more complicated or longer that it is harder to determine what are observations and what are variables and want we want to be either. It can get complicated when viewing the data in different ways and ansering different questions - not clear cut. \n",
    "# 4. values - numbers (quantitative) of strings (qualatative); variable - one way a value is organized, contains all values that measure the same attribute across units; obseravtion - another way a value is organized, contains all values measured on the same unit accross attribute\n",
    "# 5. Tidy data is a standard way of mapping the meaning of a datset to its structure: each variable forms a column, each observtaion forms a row, each type of observational unit forms a table\n",
    "# 6a. the 5 most common problems in messy datasets is column headers are values, not variable name, multiple variables start store in one column, variables are stored in both rows and columns, multiple types of observational units are store in the same table, and a single observational unit is store in multiple tables\n",
    "# 6b. The column headers are variables not titles, there are variables stored in both rows and columns\n",
    "# 6c. the reuslt of melting data is turning columns into rows, it results into molten dataset\n",
    "# 7. Table 11 is mesy due to having variables stored in both rows and columns - has variables in indvidual columns, spread across columns, and spread across rows. In table 12 with a tidy data it contains the max and min in one row and in the molten table we have dropped the missing values and the columns have become rows- uses the date\n",
    "# 8a. The chicken and the egg probelm is that one needs tidy tools to tidy data but to tidy data one needs to understand its tidy tools; so you need both tidy tools and tidy data but both rely on eachother to work so which one comes first?\n",
    "# 8b. Wickham hopes that data cleanig is studied more and improvements are made to tools and understadning of tidying data as it its a in important problem. Wickham hopes to use methodologies from fields to imporve data analsyis and to design tools to help analyze data "
